## SQL School: Tutorial Notes


These are the [notes I took](Course_Notes.md) as I worked through [Mode Analytics'](https://modeanalytics.com/)
[SQL School](https://sqlschool.modeanalytics.com/):  

* [The Basics](Lecture_Notes/basics.md)
* [Intermediate](Lecture_Notes/intermediate.md)
* [Advanced](Lecture_Notes/advanced.md)

#### Concluding Remarks:
This tutorial is a detailed hands-on introduction to SQL.
Lots of exercises ensure that the concepts are grasped well.
Using the in-browser mode sql platform is convenient.
I would recommend this to anyone looking for an introductory tutorial to SQL - I believe it is an efficient way of getting started with SQL.
